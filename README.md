# Week 0 Challenge: MoonLight Energy Solutions - Solar Radiation Data Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for the Week 0 Challenge in MoonLight Energy Solutions. This challenge is part of the evaluation for a 12-week training program in Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE). 

## Project Overview

The primary focus of this project is to analyze solar radiation data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can guide decision-making processes at MoonLight Energy Solutions. The project includes the following components:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial analysis of the data to identify trends and patterns.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applying statistical methods to derive meaningful insights.
- **Streamlit Dashboard:** Developing an interactive dashboard to visualize the findings.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

MOONLIGHT-ENERGY-ANALYSIS/ │ ├── .github/ # GitHub workflows │ └── workflows/ │ └── unittests.yml │ ├── .gitignore # Git ignore file ├── .vscode/ # VS Code settings │ └── settings.json │ ├── data/ # Contains raw and processed data files │ ├── notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks for analysis │ ├── scripts/ # Scripts for running the analysis │ ├── init.py │ └── README.md │ ├── src/ # Source code for data processing and analysis │ ├── init.py │ └── myapp.py │ ├── tests/ # Unit tests │ └── init.py │ ├── venv/ # Virtual environment │ └── requirements.txt # Python package dependencies


## How to Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eliasgirmah/moonlight-energy-analysis.git
    cd moonlight-energy-analysis
    ```

2. **Set Up a Python Environment and Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv

    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks for EDA:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/
    ```

4. **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run scripts/app.py
    ```
